# Thesis project: virtual environment for non-anthropomorphic

This project was developed for my ([Andrea Gerosa](https://github.com/Jerry98x)) thesis within the MSc Computer Science and Engineering degree at Politecnico di Milano. The title of the thesis is ___Being the Room: Embodiment of Living Spaces as Non-Anthropomorphic Avatars in Virtual Reality___ and consists of an application developed in Unity.

## Description

The project builds upon a previous thesis project (by [Giuseppe Bonanno[(https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/227395) and [Mohammadsobhan Esfandiar](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/227725)) that aimed at studying the interaction with a living social being created in the form of a mechatronic room provided with sensory organs to perceive the feedback from _Visitors_ who explore its environment.

This project aims at making people embody in VR the virtual avatar of such an exremely non-anthropomorphic entity, very distant form human beings in terms of appearance, means of interaction and perception of the world. To do so, the application I developed makes people (_Controllers_) "wear" the specially designed non-anthropomorphic virtual avatar of the Room, making them perceive the world through its senses and interact with other external entities (_Visitors_) within the environment. Moreover, it aims at making Controllers understand the presence of some other intelligent, possibly human, entity on the other side and establish a communication with it.

This work consists in three main aspects:
* Design and development of the Room's virtual avatar (and the environment it immersed in).
* Design and development of a way of interaction and a completely non-verbal code of communication for the Room organism to interact with the world.
* Design and development of a sensory translation system, which translates the feedback coming from Visitors into the unique perception of the world by the Room organism.

Neither person acting as a Controller nor the person acting as a Visitor know about the presence of the other, before trying the virtual reality experience and the exploration of the real physical Room, respectively.
